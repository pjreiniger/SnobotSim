SnobotSim is a java-based simulator that can simulate FRC Robots written in Java, with incubating support for C++ and Python.

Check out the [Release Notes](ReleaseNotes.md) to keep up with all the updates and bug fixes going on throughout the season.

## Features
* Simple physics based motor simulations
* Feedback Sensor simulation (AnalogIO, DigitalIO, Encoders, Gyros)
* [NavX Simulation](https://www.kauailabs.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=56) for the 3-axis Gyro and 3-axis Accelerometers
* [CTRE CanTalon](http://www.ctr-electronics.com/talon-srx.html) and [Pigeon IMU](http://www.ctr-electronics.com/gadgeteer-imu-module-pigeon.html) simulations.  Due to the incredble power of this speed control, I cannot guarantee that all features will work, even if they appear to.  It covers most of the control modes, but without something to test against your mileage might vary.
* Open to extension for custom I2C, SPI, Potentiometer, Motors servo'd by limit switches, etc.  Hopefully anything you need!

## Contributing
If you need any help with simulator, check the [wiki](https://github.com/pjreiniger/SnobotSim/wiki).  If that doesn't help, DM me on ChiefDelphi, `pjreiniger`

If something doesn't seem like its working, create an issue here and I will try to make a patch for you

If you find a bug you can fix, don't like how I did something, or want to add an improvment, create a Pull Request and help make the project better.

## Documentation
Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/pjreiniger/SnobotSim/wiki) for how to set up and use the simulator, or these [examples](https://github.com/pjreiniger/SnobotSimExamples) for how you might want to set things up.

## Automatic installation
Mac/Linux: Navigate to the root of your robot project, then run "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreiniger/SnobotSim/master/install.py | python3 ".
